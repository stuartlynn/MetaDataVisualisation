53m8-jdtg,17,234.0,59,Parks Concessions,"NYC Parks uses a Commercial Off-The-Shelf database for maintaining its concession-related data.  In its raw form, the Parks data within the Yardi Voyager database has a convoluted structure, the majority of which is not being used by Parks to store any data. In an effort to make the data more user friendly, the multitude of tables used by the source database have been distilled into two that contain the essential information for a concessions database. One table (“ConcessionInfo”) represents the concession asset – the place and thing which is being operated – and who holds the contract.  The other (“Transactions”) represents transactions between those contract holders and NYC Parks.  

Each row of the ConcessionsInfo table indicates all non-personally identifiable information about the asset in question including Parks’ property and location description, name of the entity that holds the contract (be it a person or corporation), and contract numbers.  This table contains elements from four tables in the source database: Property, Unit, Tenant, and Person. A property can have multiple units, each of which has a tenant, which is a person. 

In the way Parks uses this, a property can be understood as all of the concessions of a given type within a Parks property. For example, all pushcarts in Inwood Hill Park constitute a single Property.  A unit is then a subset of that property and may represent one or more of the pushcarts or an area where multiple pushcarts are allowed.  The tenant and person tables contain information about the holder of the concession.  Each unit should only have one active tenant, however a person can simultaneously be multiple tenants (indicating that they hold the contracts for multiple concessions). 

Each row of the Transactions table indicates a single transaction between the operating entity and NYC Parks.  It includes the information necessary to tie the transaction to the operating entity/asset combination, the amount, type, and date of the transaction.

Data from before 1998 is increasingly inaccurate and inconsistently entered due to a gradual adoption of the software. Contact information has also been excluded because personal contact information would have to be manually separated from corporate contact information.

Over time the data has changed in several ways.  Primarily, there has been a shift to e-mail addresses over phone and fax numbers for contact information.  Several fields have been used to record payment requirements over the system’s lifetime.  An additional field was also added to indicate whether a concession agreement required capital improvement work.

Data is entered via a web-based interface as concession agreements are created, updated, or expire, and as charges and payments are recorded.",Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),3830,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/53m8-jdtg,0.0,0.9542900080364486,0.4779505175890752,0.1963917622115608

vmkw-p55f,12,237.0,15,Parks Concession Transactions,"NYC Parks uses a Commercial Off-The-Shelf database for maintaining its concession-related data.  In its raw form, the Parks data within the Yardi Voyager database has a convoluted structure, the majority of which is not being used by Parks to store any data. In an effort to make the data more user friendly, the multitude of tables used by the source database have been distilled into two that contain the essential information for a concessions database. One table (“ConcessionInfo”) represents the concession asset – the place and thing which is being operated – and who holds the contract.  The other (“Transactions”) represents transactions between those contract holders and NYC Parks.  

Each row of the ConcessionsInfo table indicates all non-personally identifiable information about the asset in question including Parks’ property and location description, name of the entity that holds the contract (be it a person or corporation), and contract numbers.  This table contains elements from four tables in the source database: Property, Unit, Tenant, and Person. A property can have multiple units, each of which has a tenant, which is a person. 

In the way Parks uses this, a property can be understood as all of the concessions of a given type within a Parks property. For example, all pushcarts in Inwood Hill Park constitute a single Property.  A unit is then a subset of that property and may represent one or more of the pushcarts or an area where multiple pushcarts are allowed.  The tenant and person tables contain information about the holder of the concession.  Each unit should only have one active tenant, however a person can simultaneously be multiple tenants (indicating that they hold the contracts for multiple concessions). 

Each row of the Transactions table indicates a single transaction between the operating entity and NYC Parks.  It includes the information necessary to tie the transaction to the operating entity/asset combination, the amount, type, and date of the transaction.

Data from before 1998 is increasingly inaccurate and inconsistently entered due to a gradual adoption of the software. Contact information has also been excluded because personal contact information would have to be manually separated from corporate contact information.

Over time the data has changed in several ways.  Primarily, there has been a shift to e-mail addresses over phone and fax numbers for contact information.  Several fields have been used to record payment requirements over the system’s lifetime.  An additional field was also added to indicate whether a concession agreement required capital improvement work.

Data is entered via a web-based interface as concession agreements are created, updated, or expire, and as charges and payments are recorded.",Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),168160,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/vmkw-p55f,0.0,0.9542900080364486,0.4779505175890752,0.1963917622115608

This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the ""MOST_CURRENT,"" ""BBL_STATUS and ""LAST_ACTION_ON_LP"" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set.

NOTES:
1Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.
2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years’ debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year. 
3The defeasance of $536 million of GO Bonds in 2007 for reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.                                                                                                                                                                     4The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010.

In most areas, LiDAR was captured during low tide (defined here as a range between Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and MLLW + 30% of the mean tide range). All bathymetric LiDAR and most near-infrared (NIR) LiDAR was captured during low tide. Flights flown over NIR LiDAR shoreline areas that are largely made up of sea walls and riprap were not flown during low tide.

This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the ""MOST_CURRENT,"" ""BBL_STATUS and ""LAST_ACTION_ON_LP"" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set.

phkb-tkts,320,142.0,9,DSNY Waste Characterization: Citywide Subsort,"The Department conducted the 2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA (NYC Housing Authority) Waste Characterization Study over three seasons: spring, summer, and fall. This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. The study team hand sorted samples into 70 main sort categories. Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each materials is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017). 
</p>
The residential characterization included four residential curbside collection streams: Refuse, Paper, MGP (metal/glass/plastic), and Organics. 
The school characterization included Refuse, Paper, and MGP streams collected on dedicated school collection routes. For the purposes of this study, DSNY did not characterize Organics separated for diversion but instead included organic waste in the school Refuse stream. The NYCHA characterization focused sample collection from the large compacting containers used by DSNY to collect Refuse at NYCHA's large campus-style developments.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school.

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7.

Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for ""matched"" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, ""matched"" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.
In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.
For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.

Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam. 
A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.

SOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)
NOTES: 1In determining what to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city, and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city.
2GO debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury Obligations. The 2000–2002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.
3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.
4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. 
5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008
														
General Obligation:
General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.
														
														
Treasury Obligations:
Treasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.
														
Transitional Finance Authority:
Created in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.
														
TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:
In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.
														
TSASC:
TSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.
														
Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:
The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds.

Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.
</p>
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.
</p>
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",Police Department (NYPD),3843398,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/f55k-p6yu,0.0,0.9082572436765556,0.40195790729656516,0.9576909250290225

bm4k-52h4,420,125.0,25,Motor Vehicle Collisions - Vehicles,"The Motor Vehicle Collisions vehicle table contains details on each vehicle involved in the crash. Each row represents a motor vehicle involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.
</p>
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.
</p>
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",Police Department (NYPD),3311843,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/bm4k-52h4,0.0,0.9082572436765556,0.40195790729656516,0.9576909250290225

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",Department of Education (DOE),1559,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/nwrb-z58j,0.0,0.9677975592919913,0.44127456009157356,0.5358103155058701

#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",Department of Education (DOE),251,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/4g4r-7dfb,0.0,0.9677975592919913,0.44127456009157356,0.5358103155058701

NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn.

The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. 
Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.
Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.

This study builds on decades of research and analysis into the evolving composition of NYC's waste stream. The study team hand sorted samples into 70 main sort categories. Sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a sub-set of Paper products. Results are presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. The quantity of each materials is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016-June 2017). 

The residential characterization included four residential curbside collection streams: Refuse, Paper, MGP (metal/glass/plastic), and Organics. 
The school characterization included Refuse, Paper, and MGP streams collected on dedicated school collection routes. For the purposes of this study, DSNY did not characterize Organics separated for diversion but instead included organic waste in the school Refuse stream. The NYCHA characterization focused sample collection from the large compacting containers used by DSNY to collect Refuse at NYCHA's large campus-style developments.

Each of these studies share a similar methodology of waste sampling and sorting but also included different targeted analyses to characterize particular components of the waste stream. 

The 2005 study examined residential curbside collection of commingled paper and cardboard recycling (Paper); MGP (metal/glass/plastic); and trash (Refuse) that provided statistical results by housing density and income levels throughout NYC. The 2005 study also included a characterization of the contents of street litter baskets.

The 2013 study surveyed residential curbside Paper, MGP, and Refuse collections providing statistical results by borough for the City as a whole, but not by housing density and income levels. The 2013 study also included a detailed characterization of discarded plastics, as well as food and beverage containers. 
</p>
The 2017 study followed the same methodology for residential curbside collections as the 2013 study but included residential curbside collection of organics waste (Organics), NYC's new service to recycle food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste. The 2017 study also characterized collection for both NYC public schools and NYC Housing Authority buildings to create a baseline view of waste generation from these sources. The 2017 study included a detailed analysis of plastics using the same method as the 2013 study. It also included a more detailed analysis of certain paper products.

To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, ""matched"" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)
#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",Department of Education (DOE),16826,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/qfk7-6ens,126.0,0.9677975592919913,0.44127456009157356,0.5358103155058701

Notes 
Starting in 2013, the NY State Education Department (NYSED) changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm
Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website, results for ""matched"" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, ""matched"" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.
In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.
For 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015, they are not included.
Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam. 
Former English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years. 
A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014 and 2015: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempt from taking the 7th and 8th grade State math assessment. The numbers on the ""All - with Math Regents"" tab represent  the equivalent proficiency had the accelerated math students in 7th and 8th grade taken the State math assessment. An ""All Grades"" row represents how this would impact a school's overall proficiency.

As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
In 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

Rows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer.

High resolution land cover data set for New York City. This is the 6 inch version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery. The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification. Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City. As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class. At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency. The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.",Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),0,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/sknu-4f6s,0.0,0.9542900080364486,0.4779505175890752,0.1963917622115608

This data can be used by agencies and the public to better understand the demographic makeup of client populations and to better understand and serve residents of all backgrounds and identities.

The data presented here has been collected through either electronic form or paper surveys offered at the point of application for services. These surveys are anonymous.

Each record represents an anonymized demographic profile of an individual applicant for social services, disaggregated by response option, agency, and program. Response options include information regarding ancestry, race, primary and secondary languages, English proficiency, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

Idiosyncrasies or Limitations: 
Note that while the dataset contains the total number of individuals who have identified their ancestry or languages spoke, because such data is collected anonymously, there may be instances of a single individual completing multiple voluntary surveys. Additionally, the survey being both voluntary and anonymous has advantages as well as disadvantages: it increases the likelihood of full and honest answers, but since it is not connected to the individual case, it does not directly inform delivery of services to the applicant. The paper and online versions of the survey ask the same questions but free-form text is handled differently. Free-form text fields are expected to be entered in English although the form is available in several languages. Surveys are presented in 11 languages.  
  Paper Surveys
   1. Are optional

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.

The eight land cover classes mapped were: (1) Tree Canopy, (2) Grass\Shrubs, (3) Bare Soil, (4) Water, (5) Buildings, (6) Roads, (7) Other Impervious, and (8) Railroads. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2017 LiDAR (1-ft post spacing) and 2016 4-band orthoimagery (0.5-ft resolution).

As part of NYCHA's NextGeneration Sustainability Agenda, NYCHA has pledged to put 25 MW of solar power on its properties.  One of the avenues by which NYCHA aims to meet this goal is the ACcelerating Community Empowered Shared Solar (ACCESSolar) program, where smaller rooftops will be made available at low or no cost to community-based organizations and non-profits teaming up with solar developers.  The ACCESSolar program will help maximize the solar potential of NYCHA’s portfolio.  NYCHA also aims for this program to provide green jobs to residents, expand the availability of solar power to LMI populations, and facilitate first projects for start-up developers.  ACCESSolar applicants will be able to submit an application online starting in late March 2018.

NYC Parks calculates the number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as part of the Mayor’s Management Report. “Walking distance” is defined as a 1/4-mile or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 8 acres or situated on the waterfront. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis. Similarly, some parks and open-space amenities not under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide recreational value.

This dataset includes two ESRI shapefiles of access points, one for sites that get a 1/4-mile buffer and one for sites that get a 1/2-mile buffer. It also includes an ESRI shapefile of the combined polygon that is the output of this analysis. This polygon represents the total area within walking distance of a park. To generate the number of New Yorkers within that distance, the polygon is compared with data from the U.S. Census.

Source: NYC Community Health Survey (CHS) 2010-16.
The Community Health Survey (CHS) includes self-reported data from adults, years 18 and older. CHS has included adults with landline phones since 2002 and, starting in 2009, also has included adults who can be reached by cell-phone. 
Starting in 2011, CHS weighting methods were updated to use Census 2010 and additional demographic characteristics (http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/epiresearch-chsmethods.pdf ). 

Data are age-adjusted to the US 2000 Standard Population.	
Data prepared by Bureau of Epidemiology Services, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene

The New York City Community Health Survey (CHS) is a telephone survey conducted annually by the DOHMH, Division of Epidemiology, Bureau of Epidemiology Services. CHS provides robust data on the health of New Yorkers, including neighborhood, borough, and citywide estimates on a broad range of chronic diseases and behavioral risk factors. The data are analyzed and disseminated to influence health program decisions, and increase the understanding of the relationship between health behavior and health status. For more information see EpiQuery, https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/CHS/CHSXIndex.html

""TARGET POPULATION 
The target population of the CHS includes non-institutionalized adults aged 18 and older who live in a household with a landline telephone in New York City (the five borough area). Starting in 2009, adults living in households with only cell phones have also been included in the survey.

HEALTH TOPICS 
Most years the CHS includes approximately 125 questions, covering the following health topics: general health status and mental health, health care access, cardiovascular health, diabetes, asthma, immunizations, nutrition and physical activity, smoking, HIV, sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, cancer screening and other health topics. A core group of demographics variables are included every year to facilitate weighting and comparisons among different groups of New Yorkers.

SAMPLING 
The CHS uses a stratified random sample to produce neighborhood and citywide estimates. Neighborhoods are defined using the United Hospital Fund's (UHF) neighborhood designation, which assigns neighborhood based on the ZIP code of the respondent. New ZIP codes have been added since the UHF's were originally defined. There are 42 UHF neighborhoods in NYC. However, to avoid small sample sizes for CHS estimates, UHF estimates are generally collapsed into 34 UHFs/groups.

Starting in 2009, a second sample consisting of cell-only households with New York City exchanges was added. This design is non-overlapping because in the cell-only sample, adults living in households with landline telephones were screened out.

A computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system is used to collect the survey data. The CHS sampling frame was constructed with a list of telephone numbers provided by a commercial vendor. Upon agreement to participate in the survey, one adult is randomly selected from the household to complete the interview.

Interviewing is conducted in a variety of languages. Every year, the questionnaire is translated from English into Spanish, Russian, and Chinese. Some years, live translation services are provided by Language Line (including Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, and Haitian Creole). Typically, data collection begins in March of the study year and ends in December. The average length of the survey is 25 minutes.

LIMITATIONS 
The survey sampling methodology does not capture the following groups: households without any telephone service and (prior to 2009) households that only have a cell phone. The CHS also excludes adults living in institutional group housing, such as college dormitories.

hnxz-kkn5,4371,2568.0,0,NYC Urban Tree Canopy Assessment Metrics 2010,"Tree Canopy (TC) Assessment metrics for New York City.  This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.

The TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). 

Existing TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  

Possible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   

TC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.

The TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.",Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),0,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/hnxz-kkn5,0.0,0.9542900080364486,0.4779505175890752,0.1963917622115608

OPT staff use a variety of systems to generate and share bus route information with bus vendors and the public. Specific bus route paths cannot be publicly disclosed because they could reveal personally identifiable information about individual students. In this dataset, OPT has provided all the route information that does not risk disclosing personally identifiable information. 
School-age service for students in grades K through 12 are contracted with bus vendors on a per route basis. OPT also manages bus service for Pre-K students who require curb-to-curb service as per a student’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This Pre-K bus service is contracted on a per student basis, instead of per route. As a consequence of this difference, OPT does not design bus routes for Pre-K service, so those routes are not included in this dataset.
There are a variety of different vehicles used on routes that serve students requiring curb-to-curb service because an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) indicates specific transportation needs. The standard bus is the only vehicle used for general education routes with students eligible for bus service but who do not have an IEP.
Users may occasionally see a route without a garage assignment. Because this dataset is derived from a snapshot of a transactional system, there may be routes that are in the process of being assigned to a garage.

This dataset includes information of BID-owned and Privately-owned litter baskets.

Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water.

This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.

Similarly, neighborhoods with higher rates of active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.

h9gi-nx95,221795,58451.0,29,Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes,"The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.
</p>
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",Police Department (NYPD),1655618,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/h9gi-nx95,0.0,0.9082572436765556,0.40195790729656516,0.9576909250290225

A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed. The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs.
